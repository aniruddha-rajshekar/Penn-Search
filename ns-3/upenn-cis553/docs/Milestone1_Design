MILESTONE 1 DESIGN

	The Neighbor Discovery begins with NeighborDiscovery() function being called by an initiator node. This functions initiates the process by broadcasting a packet named 'ND_REQ' with TTL as 1. Since all the neighbors lie within one hop, they receive the initiator packet. The neighbors then reply to the initiator node with a packet named 'ND_RSP'. As the the initiator node receives the 'ND_RSP' packet, it confirms whether the packet is addressed to itself, and if it is, it retrieves the neighbor's address using the GetOriginatorAddress() function. The initiator also makes a note of the socket through which it received the ND_RSP packet and retrieves the Interface Address using 'm_socketAddresses' table. With the required data available, the initiator immadiately updates the 'm_neighborTable' table. To reiterate the process with regular intervals, we use a timer 'm_ndTimer' and a timeout value 'm_ndTimeout' which is set to 2000ms.

Since the neighbor discovery happens every 'm_ndTimeout' time, the changes in the topology might atmost take 'm_ndTimeout' time to be reflected in the 'm_neighborTable' table.

The 'm_neighborTable' is a map which stores the information about neighbors in the form of entries.Each entry has a key value as node number and a structure variable 'NeighborTableEntry' which contains Neighbor's main address and the current node's interface address that is connected to this particular node.

The neighbor discovery functions in both 'LS' and 'DV' routing protocols imitate each other. They follow the same procedure to discover the neighbors.
